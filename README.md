## 📦 About

[Codeium Windsurf AI Editor](https://codeium.com/) is a standalone code editor based on VS Code, designed to work seamlessly with Codeium's AI-powered coding assistance. However, its official distribution only provides a **tarball download** without proper integration into package managers like `pacman`.

This repository exists **only** to automate the process of installing Codeium Windsurf AI Editor via the AUR.
